I’m Rakesh Kumawat, a full-stack and blockchain developer.
===============================

Beyond coding, I love connecting with the community. I’ve had the privilege of judging prestigious hackathons, hosting blockchain workshops, and speaking at some of the biggest colleges and tech communities. Sharing knowledge and sparking curiosity in others is something I truly enjoy - whether it’s through a talk, a meetup, or just a casual chat.
