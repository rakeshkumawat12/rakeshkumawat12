Hi, I'm Rakesh Kumawat - Full Stack Developer and Frontend Enthusiast!
===============================

I'm passionate about crafting dynamic and seamless digital experiences. As a full stack developer, I specialize in building robust end-to-end applications, with a strong inclination towards frontend development where creativity meets functionality.

Beyond coding, I enjoy solving challenging programming problems and exploring the exciting world of blockchain and Web3 technologies. With hands-on experience in developing MERN stack applications and cutting-edge RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) solutions, I thrive on innovation and delivering impactful projects.

Community engagement is close to my heart. I actively contribute to open-source projects, share knowledge through technical blogs and posts on LinkedIn and X (formerly Twitter), and mentor beginners by breaking down complex concepts into clear, actionable insights. Public speaking is another avenue where I connect with the tech community, delivering talks that inspire and educate.

Let's build the future of technology together! 🚀
